**Contributor(s) request:** Seeking partner/contributor (preferably with Biomes mod experience since I am a Biomes noob and have never coded a mod). Looking for someone who can help with coding work and art and design/balancing

**Biome Name:** Polarity

**Central idea/theme:** Big upsides and big downsides, both temporary and permanent

**Node effects:**

  **Combats (normal and elite)**: At the start of each combat, shuffle 2 wounds and 2 random cards that cost 2 energy or more, discarded by 2 energy, into your draw pile.
 
**Card rewards**: Card rewards are all uncommon and upgraded, but cost 3 max health to take.

**Shops**: All shops have 50% chance of having 
  - A) No cards. Relics costs 25% less. Potions and card removals cost 50% less.
  - B) No relics, potions, or card removals. Cards are all on sale (cost 50% less). 

**Fires**: Resting heals to full but costs 5 max health (Night Terrors). Smithing upgrades 2 cards but chooses them at random.

**Question marks:**

  - First question mark in the biome: Wheel of Change event (even if it has already occured this Act)

- Subsequent question marks in the biome: 1/3 chance of Elite fight, 1/3 chance of Treasure room, 1/3 chance of Wheel of Change event (even if it has already occured this Act)
