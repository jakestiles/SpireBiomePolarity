# SpireBiomePolarity
A Slay the Spire mod idea, meant for the Spire Biomes mod


**Usage:** Please do not use these ideas without asking. Discord name: jakestiles

**Contributor(s) request:** Seeking partner/contributor (preferably with Biomes mod experience since I am a Biomes noob and have never coded a mod). Looking for someone who can help with coding work and art and design/balancing

**Biome Name:** Polarity

**Central idea/theme:** Big upsides and big downsides, both temporary and permanent

**Biome size details:** Should include at least one question mark since Forever Changed is a big portion of why this Biome exists.

**Node effects:**

**Combats (normal and elite)**: Before each combat, gain 1 random temporary upside and 1 random temporary downside that will take effect for only that combat. (Preferable: You can't be given anything you've been given before during this run.) Value of X is always the Act Number. 
	
- Temporary upsides: +X strength, +X dexterity, +1 energy per turn, draw X additional cards per turn, Metallicize X*2, +X Focus (Defect only)
 
- Temporary downsides: -X strength, -X dexterity, At start of combat shuffle X wounds into your draw pile, enemies gain Thorns X*2.
 
**Card rewards**: Card rewards are all upgraded, and have 1 additional option, but cost 3 max health to take.

**Shops**: Shops are half price and half stock (a randomly selected 7 of all items are missing or unpurchasable)

**Treasure rooms**: All treasure chests have 50% chance of having A) rare relics, but no money. or B) no relics (blue key still present), but guaranteed money and triple the amount of it.

**Fires**: Resting heals to full but costs 5 max health (Night Terrors). Smithing upgrades 2 cards but chooses them at random.

**Question marks:**

- First question mark in the biome: New event named "Forever Changed": Choose a permanent downside (choice of 2) then choose a permanent upside (choice of 2). First question mark per run in this biome is guaranteed to be "Forever Changed" then the event is disabled. See below for possible choices.

- Subsequent question marks in the biome: 1/3 chance of Elite fight, 1/3 chance of Treasure room, 1/3 chance of Wheel of Change event

**Forever Changed Event, upsides:**

- Gain Heart of Gold, unique relic: The first time you lose health each floor, gain 10 gold. There is an additional shop before the Heart. (Note: Not acquirable with Ectoplasm)
